Abstract
We introduce MindSpore Quantum, a pioneering hybrid quantum-classical framework with a primary focus on the design and implementation of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms. Leveraging the robust support of MindSpore, an advanced open-source deep learning training/inference framework, MindSpore Quantum exhibits exceptional efficiency in the design and training of variational quantum algorithms on both CPU and GPU platforms, delivering remarkable performance. Furthermore, this framework places a strong emphasis on enhancing the operational efficiency of quantum algorithms when executed on real quantum hardware. This encompasses the development of algorithms for quantum circuit compilation and qubit mapping, crucial components for achieving optimal performance on quantum processors. In addition to the core framework, we introduce QuPack, a meticulously crafted quantum computing acceleration engine. QuPack significantly accelerates the simulation speed of MindSpore Quantum, particularly in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), and tensor network simulations, providing astonishing speed. This combination of cutting-edge technologies empowers researchers and practitioners to explore the frontiers of quantum computing with unprecedented efficiency and performance.
