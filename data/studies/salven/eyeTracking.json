  "title": "Usability Assessment of a University Academic Portal using Eye Tracking Technology",
  "abstract": "Focusing on Zayed Universityâ€™s e-services portal, this experiment combined eye-tracking metrics with navigation analytics from young Arab female students. Results show prolonged visual search times and under-utilization of key services, suggesting design-induced cognitive load. Recommendations include streamlined information architecture, clearer link labels, and iterative usability testing to enhance portal efficiency and student uptake.",
