  "title": "Assessing User Satisfaction and Usability of a University Portal: A Quantitative Study Utilizing the Computer System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ)",
  "abstract": "Using a modified CSUQ instrument, this study surveyed 185 undergraduates at Mindanao State University to evaluate the OPEN student portal across usefulness, information quality, interface quality, and overall usability. Descriptive analysis shows high satisfaction on all four dimensions, indicating the portal’s positive impact on academic tasks. The authors nonetheless caution that findings are institution-specific and call for continuous monitoring, iterative design updates, and routine user-feedback loops to maintain relevance and improve the portal’s user experience.",
