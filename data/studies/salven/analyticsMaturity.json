  "title": "Strategic Implications of Analytics Maturity in Higher Education Marketing",
  "abstract": "This report synthesizes findings from the 2024 EDUCAUSE Analytics Landscape Study, which surveyed hundreds of higher education institutions to evaluate the state of analytics practices across governance, workforce, technology, and institutional readiness. Through quantitative and qualitative data collection—including leadership sentiment, resource allocation, and adoption of AI tools—the study maps out current capabilities and barriers in leveraging analytics for strategic decision-making. The data shows that while 79% of institutions report leadership interest or commitment to analytics, the majority lack key roles such as Chief Data Officers and centralized data systems, limiting operational impact. Most analytics applications are still concentrated in compliance and enrollment management, with underutilization in brand development, personalized communication, and digital engagement. For marketing and digital leaders, the findings signal both a lag in institutional adaptation and a clear opportunity: by championing investments in analytics staff, tools, and data governance, marketing units can play a central role in transforming institutional strategy, increasing student retention, and reinforcing brand leadership in a competitive global education market. The study offers immediate and long-term recommendations, from fostering cross-departmental collaboration to embedding ethical and inclusive data practices that elevate both institutional trust and external reputation.",
