  "title": "Unveiling the barriers to digital transformation in higher education institutions: a systematic literature review",
  "abstract": "Drawing on 20 peer-reviewed studies published between 2019 and 2024, this systematic literature review maps the nine most persistent barrier dimensions—digital vision & strategy, leadership, organization, resources, competence, stakeholder management, culture, academic practice, and ethics—that impede large universities from realising long-term digital transformation. Using PRISMA procedures plus NVivo-based thematic coding, the author synthesises 80 specific obstacles (e.g., fragmented governance, unclear ROI, low digital literacy) into a concept-centric matrix that can guide change-management road-mapping and stakeholder engagement plans in academic settings.",
