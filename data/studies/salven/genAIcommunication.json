  "title": "The new normal: The increasing adoption of generative AI in university communication",
  "abstract": "This study examines the evolving use of generative AI (genAI) tools in the communication departments of German universities, using comparative survey data collected in 2023 and 2024. Conducted through a standardized online survey of 318 university communication heads (with 82 responses in 2024), the study provides a cross-sectional analysis of adoption rates, usage patterns, strategic integration, and institutional responses to genAI tools. The findings reveal a substantial increase in genAI adoption—especially for text generation (rising from 22% to 59% regular use)—alongside a growing maturity in applications, including translation, multilingual content adaptation, and strategic communication planning. Private institutions exhibited higher adoption rates than public ones, likely due to fewer regulatory constraints. While genAI tools have improved efficiency and adaptability, their integration into team structures and workflows remains limited, and satisfaction varies by application area. Persistent challenges include concerns over factual accuracy (72%) and data protection (68%), though technical issues have diminished. Institutions have increasingly established working groups, guidelines, and training to support genAI integration. The study applies the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and Socio-Technical Systems Theory (STS) to explain adoption dynamics, highlighting a shift from experimentation to mainstream integration. Implications include the need for improved ethical guidance, AI literacy, and strategic planning to ensure effective and responsible use of genAI tools in university communication.",
