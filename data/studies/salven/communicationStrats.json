  "title": "Navigating the AI Era: University Communication Strategies and Perspectives on Generative AI Tools",
  "abstract": "This study provides the first empirical investigation into the use and perception of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, within university communication departments across Germany. Conducted in May 2023, the research employed a partially standardized online survey targeting heads of press offices and communication departments at 318 German universities (response rate: 32%). The study applies the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and Socio-Technical Systems (STS) theory to analyze technology adoption, examining factors such as usefulness, ease of use, institutional readiness, and ethical considerations. Findings reveal that while tools for translation and language correction (e.g., DeepL) are widely adopted (73% regular use), generative AI applications like ChatGPT see only moderate regular usage (21%). Private universities show higher adoption rates compared to public institutions, primarily due to fewer regulatory barriers. Satisfaction with AI tools remains mixed, with data privacy (52%) and ethical concerns (42%) among the most cited challenges. Respondents valued efficiency and time-saving over personalization or quality improvements, and only a small fraction of institutions had strategic goals or training in place. The study highlights a cautious but growing integration of AI tools in university communication, emphasizing the need for training, organizational alignment, and ethical guidelines to support responsible adoption.",
