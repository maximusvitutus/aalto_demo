  "title": "Homepage Redesign 2023: Surveys, Usability Testing, and Tiny Cafés",
  "abstract": "This study documents a comprehensive three-year redesign of a university libraries homepage, led by the User Experience department. The process involved benchmarking against peer institutions, conducting ideation workshops, creating wireframes, gathering stakeholder feedback, and implementing iterative user research. Between November 2022 and April 2023, six separate studies engaged over 100 participants, including students, staff, and faculty. Methodologies included remote usability testing, in-person 'Tiny Café' research pop-ups, surveys, and A/B testing of homepage variants. Results highlighted user preferences for clean layouts, effective visual hierarchy, and accessible navigation. The final design included a prominent hero image, refined search box placement, colored section backgrounds, and usability enhancements aligned with user feedback. Findings underscore the importance of iterative, user-centered design and stakeholder collaboration in digital interface redesigns. The new homepage launched in May 2023, incorporating ongoing feedback mechanisms to ensure continued responsiveness to user needs.",
