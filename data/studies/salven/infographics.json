  "title": "Infographics Are More Effective at Increasing Social Media Attention in Comparison With Original Research Articles: An Altmetrics-Based Analysis",
  "abstract": "This matched-cohort study assessed whether visual abstracts (infographics) drive greater online attention than full-text research articles in the journal *Arthroscopy*. All 2019 infographics (n = 12) were paired 1 : 4 with topic-matched original research papers (n = 48). Altmetric Attention Score (AAS)—a composite measure of mentions across Twitter, Facebook, news outlets and blogs—served as the primary outcome; citation counts were secondary. Independent t-tests, χ² tests and multivariate linear regression (controlling for article type, topic, word count and author number) were applied. Infographics achieved a mean AAS of 29.8 ± 32.8 versus 5.8 ± 8.9 for controls (P < .001) and were more frequently shared on Twitter (100 % vs 70.8 %) and Facebook (75 % vs 6.2 %; both P < .001). Regression indicated that publication as an infographic independently increased AAS by 33.7 points (95 % CI 11.6–50.6; P = .003). Citation rates after one year did not differ (2.4 vs 2.2; P = .69). The results demonstrate that journal-curated infographics substantially amplify immediate social-media visibility without translating into early citation gains. Routine production of high-quality visual abstracts could extend a journal’s digital reach, but clinicians should still consult the full paper to avoid oversimplified interpretations in decision-making.",
