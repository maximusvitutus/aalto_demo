  "title": "Best Practices for Usability Testing in Academic Libraries: A Human-Centered, Iterative Approach",
  "abstract": "This study provides a comprehensive, practice-based framework for conducting usability testing in academic libraries, grounded in qualitative interviews with nine UX-focused librarians across the U.S. Using semi-structured interviews, the study identifies recurring themes and codifies best practices in three phases: planning and implementation, conducting the test, and follow-up. The findings emphasize the centrality of relationship-building with diverse user groups, the importance of objectivity and accessibility, and the need to normalize usability testing as a recurring practice. The research shows that usability testing is not only a diagnostic tool for web design flaws but also a strategic, humanistic practice that enhances institutional trust, user co-ownership, and iterative service design. The author outlines actionable practices supported by UX literature, such as collaborative facilitation, frequent and flexible testing schedules, IRB considerations, scope containment, and accessible recruitment methods. A key implication is that usability testing must be integrated into the culture of library services, not treated as an isolated event. The study culminates in the development of a publicly available DIY usability testing toolkit designed to empower librarians of all experience levels to launch sustainable, inclusive usability programs that improve the user experience while strengthening the libraryâ€™s value proposition.",
