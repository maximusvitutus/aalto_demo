  "title": "The Role of AI Personalization in Shaping Students' Decision-making: The Mediating Role of Students' Intentions and the Moderating Effect of Academic Technology Experience in Higher Education",
  "abstract": "This study explores how AI-powered personalization influences university studentsâ€™ decision-making, with a focus on the mediating role of intention to apply and the moderating effect of academic technology experience. A survey of 425 students across diverse academic fields and technology proficiency levels was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to test a model grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior. Results show that AI personalization directly impacts student decision-making, particularly by enhancing trust and program alignment, but does not significantly influence intention to apply on its own. Instead, intention to apply partially mediates the relationship between personalization and decision-making, suggesting that fostering early engagement is key to influencing final enrollment choices. Additionally, students with higher levels of academic technology experience were more responsive to AI personalization, highlighting the importance of tailoring strategies based on digital literacy. The study offers actionable insights for universities to design more inclusive, personalized communication strategies that increase engagement and institutional trust while acknowledging disparities in technology experience. These findings advance understanding of how AI personalization, when ethically and strategically implemented, can enhance recruitment outcomes and inform the future of digital marketing in higher education.",
