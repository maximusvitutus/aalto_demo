  "title": "Improving Service Quality at Universities through Student Journey Mapping",
  "abstract": "This qualitative pilot at the University of Zielona Góra evaluates Student Journey Mapping (SJM) as a lean Six-Sigma-style diagnostic for the undergraduate recruitment funnel. Twenty-two first-year logistics majors participated in semi-structured video interviews covering the three macro phases—decision-making, online recruitment workflow, and onboarding. Following Kalbach’s mapping protocol, transcripts were coded for touch-points, emotions, and «moments of truth»; emergent issues were plotted on persona-specific journey tables. The composite map exposed 14 recurrent friction points: unclear degree descriptions, inability to locate ranking-list IDs, missing feedback on receipt of paper documents, and conflicting schedules between kick-off meetings and first-week classes. Root-cause grouping suggested systemic gaps between functional silos (Admissions vs. Student Services) and poor cross-channel communication design. Proposed countermeasures included a «Welcome Point» one-stop portal, bolded ranking numbers, automated acknowledgement emails, and explainer infographics for StudNet account creation. Although limited by COVID-19-era remote interviewing and a modest sample size, the study shows that SJM can capture emotional pain-points invisible to conventional satisfaction surveys and can seed a prioritised backlog for continuous process improvement in university service operations.",
