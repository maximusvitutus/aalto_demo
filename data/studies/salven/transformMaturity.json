  "title": "Assessing digital transformation maturity in higher education institutions: a correlational analysis by actors and dimensions",
  "abstract": "This quantitative study surveys 338 managers, administrators, faculty, and students at a comprehensive Latin-American university to gauge maturity across eight dimensions (Sociocultural, Teaching-Learning, Digital Governance, Research-Innovation, Academic & Administrative Management, Institutional Image-Marketing, University Extension). Spearman correlations reveal that Digital Governance acts as the keystone dimension linking strategy, outreach, and innovation, while maturity perceptions vary significantly by stakeholder group. The findings inform customised, actor-specific transformation roadmaps and governance models for large public universities seeking agile, evidence-based change.",
