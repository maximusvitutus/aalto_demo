    "topic": "Using Digital Data to Understand Social Networks and Commutes",
    "methodology": "Researchers analyzed large-scale digital traces of human behavior to model changes and persistence in social and commuting networks, while developing computational models to explain these phenomena and validate sociological theories.",
    "findings": "Both personal social networks and commuting patterns show dynamic changes but maintain core persistent features, and the study identified universal and individual traits, demonstrated how social tie complexity shapes network functions, and built models predicting human mobility in real time.",
    "implications": "This work highlights how digital data can reveal and predict large-scale social dynamics, helping bridge classical and computational social sciences and offering practical tools for understanding and managing social and mobility systems."

    "topic": "How Timing and Memory Affect Reciprocity in Human Communication",
    "methodology": "Researchers developed new measures to analyze the timing of reciprocal communications across different channels, using empirical data and mathematical models to understand drivers of reciprocity.",
    "findings": "They found that memory—our tendency to interact repeatedly with familiar contacts—is key to maintaining reciprocity over time, and accurately modeled these effects in simulations.",
    "implications": "Understanding these patterns explains how norms and cooperation arise in social systems, offering insights for designing more stable and cohesive communication platforms."
