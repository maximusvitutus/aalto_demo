    "topic": "How Timing Shapes Reciprocal Communication in Social Networks",
    "methodology": "Researchers analyzed communication patterns across calls, messaging, and social media to measure how reciprocation occurs over time, distinguishing between one-to-one exchanges and broader information broadcasts.",
    "findings": "The study found that people tend to communicate repeatedly with the same contacts, and this memory for past interactions is crucial in creating temporal reciprocity, which can be replicated in theoretical network models.",
    "implications": "Understanding the timing and memory-driven nature of reciprocal communication helps explain how social norms and cooperative behaviors emerge and persist in both small groups and large online communities."
