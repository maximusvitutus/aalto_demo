    "topic": "The Timing of Reciprocity in Communication",
    "methodology": "This study investigated the temporal patterns of reciprocal interactions in various communication channels, employing measures that reflect the time order of exchanges.",
    "findings": "It revealed that memory-driven interactions significantly influence temporal reciprocity, highlighting differences between one-to-one communication and information broadcasting.",
    "implications": "Understanding these patterns can improve our grasp of how norms emerge in social exchanges and enhance cooperation on larger scales."
