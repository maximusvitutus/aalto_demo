          "title": "Dynamic yet Persistent: Investigating Digital Traces of Human Behaviour",
          "abstract": "We are citizens of the digital age, an age in which our smallest everyday actions leave digital traces behind. These traces can be used to reconstruct and analyse the patterns of human behaviour at both individual and societal levels. The growing abundance of quantitative data on almost every aspect of human behaviour is driving a paradigm shift from traditional social sciences to computational social sciences. This thesis utilises a wide range of digital traces of human behaviour to study and model the structure of social networks, as well as population-level patterns of commuting and travelling. A longitudinal study of these patterns reveals that while both personal social networks and population commuting networks are dynamic and undergo gradual changes and abrupt external disturbances, they also exhibit persistence in certain aspects and retain some of their distinctive features. Our work advances the knowledge of personal networks by identifying their universal and individual features through the study of a large population and multiple communication media. To clarify the generative mechanisms behind the observed universal patterns and individual variations within them, we present an ego-network model that connects the structure of ego-networks to the communication strategies of egos. Furthermore, we utilise rich and high-resolution digital communication logs and computational methods to validate the predictions of sociological theories that predate the emergence of computational social science as a field. Particularly, we show that the temporal manifestation of social ties can indicate the extent of their multiplexity (i.e., whether multiple social contexts underlie the tie) and that the multiplexity of ties impacts their functional features, such as their role in network connectivity. In addition to social networks, this thesis enriches our understanding of human mobility patterns by building predictive models that employ digital traces data. These models are capable of real-time estimation of country-wide mobility flows, even amidst rapid and significant distortions in mobility patterns. Taken together, my results highlight the potential of digital trace data and computational methods for advancing our understanding of various aspects of human behaviour. It applies these insights to predict human behaviour, identify universal and individual human traits, and contribute to bridging the new field of computational social science with the rich tradition of classical social science.",

          "reasoning": "The abstract discusses the use of digital trace data and computational methods to model and understand changes in human social networks and mobility patterns at both the individual and population levels. The research aims to identify universal and individual features of social networks, illuminate mechanisms behind these patterns, and demonstrate predictive modeling of large-scale human mobility. The focus is on leveraging digital data to advance computational social science and integrate it with classical social science. Comparing this with reader interests: (1) the work directly relates to the emergence of computational social science—a key technological and methodological shift with implications for how societies self-organize and adapt; (2) the modeling of social networks and human mobility through digital traces signals new ways societies may be governed, coordinated, or understood, addressing how technology influences agency, institution, and collective behavior; (3) the work's focus on predictive modeling and responding to abrupt changes in societal patterns (like mobility) ties into economics, crisis response, infrastructure, and the adaptation of societal systems; (4) the analysis of multiplexity, network structure, and validation of sociological theories touches on the evolution of collective meaning-making and adaptation of norms under technological disruption. The readers’ stated interest is explicitly in the kinds of systemic, technology-driven shifts that this research both investigates and models. The motivation—to explain cutting-edge university research to a broad, thoughtful audience—fits well, as the study provides foundational insights into methods and findings relevant to societal future thinking. The work does not address every reader interest equally (e.g., less on belief systems and direct policy implications), but its conceptual and methodological thrust is highly aligned with the feed's theme and readers' long-range concerns about societal transformation.",

          "abstract": "The development of legitimate, operative, and feasible landscape adaptation planning for climate change is dependent on the specific characteristics of the landscape and its inhabitants. Spatial patterns, culture, governance systems, socio-economic structures, planning methods, history, and collectively envisioned futures need to be accommodated. The literature suggests that landscape is a complex and dynamic socio-ecological system, the management and adaptation of which requires systemic and integrative approaches to respond to a wide variety of drivers of change, challenges, and interests. Based on activities developed in 15 European pilot landscapes, we identify some of the key factors and conditions affecting the generation of representative local networks for landscape adaptation to climate change. We illustrate how social learning and co-creation processes can be implemented in them and how their co-produced outcomes can help local communities overcome barriers and address critical issues in adaptive planning. Our results provide a framework for the creation of similar networks in other landscapes, exploring at the same time the interactions between the composition of networks, social learning, and the quality of the co-produced outputs as a fundamental step for the development of Landscape Adaptation Plans to Climate Change.",

The processes of social learning, co-creation, network formation, and the negotiation of collective futures directly relate to how power is organized, how agency is expressed, how communities govern themselves under stress, and how institutions adapt. Although the study is specific to landscape and environmental planning, the methods and dynamics it explores are clear analogs (and potential signals) for broader shifts in how societies mobilize, deliberate, and adapt at scale.

          "title": "On Sustainable Ring-Based Anonymous Systems",
          "abstract": "Anonymous systems (e.g. anonymous cryptocurrencies and updatable anonymous credentials) often follow a construction template where an account can only perform a single anonymous action, which in turn potentially spawns new (and still single-use) accounts (e.g. UTXO with a balance to spend or session with a score to claim). Due to the anonymous nature of the action, no party can be sure which account has taken part in an action and, therefore, must maintain an ever-growing list of potentially unused accounts to ensure that the system keeps running correctly. Consequently, anonymous systems constructed based on this common template are seemingly not sustainable. In this work, we study the sustainability of ring-based anonymous systems, where a user performing an anonymous action is hidden within a set of decoy users, traditionally called a 'ring'. On the positive side, we propose a general technique for ring-based anonymous systems to achieve sustainability. Along the way, we define a general model of decentralised anonymous systems (DAS) for arbitrary anonymous actions, and provide a generic construction which provably achieves sustainability. As a special case, we obtain the first construction of anonymous cryptocurrencies achieving sustainability without compromising availability. We also demonstrate the generality of our model by constructing sustainable decentralised anonymous social networks. On the negative side, we show empirically that Monero, one of the most popular anonymous cryptocurrencies, is unlikely to be sustainable without altering its current ring sampling strategy. The main subroutine is a sub-quadratic-time algorithm for detecting used accounts in a ring-based anonymous system.",

The contribution includes both theoretical models and practical algorithms addressing scalability and viability of technologies that promise privacy and decentralization. Comparing to the reader interests, there is strong indirect and some direct alignment: anonymous cryptocurrencies and decentralized social networks are at the vanguard of reimagining economic organization, identity, privacy, and even governance. How these systems sustain themselves over time is crucial for understanding possible future shifts in societal power, coordination, and norms—key concerns for this audience. The work may illuminate risks, new patterns of digital agency, shifts in trust paradigms, and the evolution or fragmentation of institutional legitimacy (especially in a world of increasing digital-native social contracts). While the abstract is quite technical, the implications it carries are highly relevant for understanding large-scale transitions in identity, agency, cooperation, and public infrastructure that this audience tracks.

          "abstract": "Human communication, the essence of collective social phenomena ranging from small-scale organizations to worldwide online platforms, features intense reciprocal interactions between members in order to achieve stability, cohesion, and cooperation in social networks. While high levels of reciprocity are well known in aggregated communication data, temporal patterns of reciprocal information exchange have received far less attention. Here we propose measures of reciprocity based on the time ordering of interactions and explore them in data from multiple communication channels, including calls, messaging and social media. By separating each channel into reciprocal and non-reciprocal temporal networks, we find persistent trends that point to the distinct roles of one-to-one exchange versus information broadcast. We implement several null models of communication activity, which identify memory, a higher tendency to repeat interactions with past contacts, as a key source of temporal reciprocity. When adding memory to a model of activity-driven, time-varying networks, we reproduce the levels of temporal reciprocity seen in empirical data. Our work adds to the theoretical understanding of the emergence of reciprocity in human communication systems, hinting at the mechanisms behind the formation of norms in social exchange and large-scale cooperation.",

These readers are especially keen on understanding how new technologies (such as decentralized social networks) might signal or enable shifts in power, governance, collective action, and meaning-making. Decentralized platforms challenge established socio-technical architectures of control, moderation, and identity, which are core concerns outlined in the reader interests—such as emerging trends in organizational power, the redefinition of social contracts, and the fragmentation or evolution of collective meaning-making systems. Furthermore, the ability to observe user behavior, moderation, and community evolution in a decentralized context aligns with the readers’ quest to track shifts in governance structures and understand new forms of agency.

          "abstract": "An increasing number of online services are hosted on public clouds. However, since a centralized cloud architecture imposes high network latency, researchers suggested moving latency sensitive applications, such as virtual and augmented reality ones, to the edge of the network. Nevertheless, little has been done for edge layer capacity estimation resulting in a great need towards practical tools and techniques for initial capacity planning. In this work we provide a novel capacity planning solution for hierarchical edge cloud that considers QoS requirements in terms of response delay, and diverse demands for CPU, GPU and network resources. Our solution improves edge utilization by combining complementary resource demands while satisfying QoS requirements. We prove effectiveness of our solution through a case study where we plan edge capacity for deploying an AR navigation and information system.",

          "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining increasing popularity. Overwhelming volumes of data are generated by IoT devices. Those data after analytics provide significant information that could greatly benefit IoT applications. Different from traditional applications, IoT applications, such as environmental monitoring, smart navigation, and smart healthcare come with new requirements, such as mobility, real-time response, and location awareness. However, traditional cloud computing paradigm cannot satisfy these demands due to centralized processing and being far away from local devices. Hence, edge computing was introduced to perform data processing and storage in the edge of networks, which is closer to data sources than cloud computing, thus efficient and location-aware. Unfortunately, edge computing brings new security and privacy challenges when applied to data analytics. The literature still lacks a thorough review on the recent advances in secure data analytics in edge computing. In this paper, we first introduce the concept and features of edge computing, and then propose a number of requirements for its secure data analytics by analyzing potential security threats in edge computing. Furthermore, we give a comprehensive review on the pros and cons of the existing works on data analytics in edge computing based on our proposed requirements. Based on our literature survey, we highlight current open issues and propose future research directions.",

IoT data are currently processed in the cloud, mostly through computing resources located in distant data centers. As a consequence, network bandwidth and communication latency become serious bottlenecks. This article advocates edge computing for emerging IoT applications that leverage sensor streams to augment interactive applications. First, we classify and survey current edge computing architectures and platforms, then describe key IoT application scenarios that benefit from edge computing. Second, we carry out an experimental evaluation of edge computing and its enabling technologies in a selected use case represented by mobile gaming. To this end, we consider a resource-intensive 3D application as a paradigmatic example and evaluate the response delay in different deployment scenarios. Our experimental results show that edge computing is necessary to meet the latency requirements of applications involving virtual and augmented reality. We conclude by discussing what can be achieved with current edge computing platforms and how emerging technologies will impact on the deployment of future IoT applications.",

The focus is broad, but centers on how MEC brings IT and telecommunications closer at the network edge, relevant architectures, deployment models, and outstanding research challenges. \n\nStep 2: Comparing this to the reader interests: MEC is foundational to next-generation wireless systems and intelligent networks. Technology strategists, R&D engineers, and product/platform leaders at Nokia will find the discussion of orchestration, architecture, and deployment highly relevant for both current 5G and future 6G planning. The focus on orchestration, standardization, and open challenges will interest innovation managers and academic partnership leads, especially for identifying joint projects or funding opportunities. There is indirect but meaningful relevance to edge AI (since MEC is an enabler), and to network security and energy efficiency (since these are typically part of orchestration debates, though not prominently mentioned in the abstract). However, the paper is less directly aligned with topics like sustainable materials, digital inclusion, or trust/user experience, unless these are implied within the broader orchestration and deployment discussion.
