          "title": "Dynamic yet Persistent: Investigating Digital Traces of Human Behaviour"
        },
        "relevanceScore": {
          "reasoning": "First, the abstract describes a thesis that leverages digital traces of human behavior to analyze social networks and commuting patterns, employing computational social science methods. It highlights the persistence and dynamics of social ties, presents models for ego-networks (reflecting individual social connections), and validates sociological theories using digital data. The thesis specifically explores how the structure and function of personal social networks can be understood and modeled computationally, including facets like the multiplexity of ties and their impact on network connectivity. It also covers predictive models for large-scale mobility patterns.\n\nFor the reader interests, which focus on studies that deal with interpersonal relationships, there is a direct thematic match: a significant portion of the research concerns the structure, dynamics, persistence, and function of personal social networks (ego-networks) and interpersonal ties. This includes the study of universal and individual features in such networks, the multiplex nature of social ties, and how these relationships manifest in digital communication patterns. The research extends beyond interpersonal relationships somewhat (covering population-level mobility), but the core contribution about personal ties is deeply relevant.\n\nRegarding the intended reader (a donor interested in interpersonal relationship studies) and the distribution motivation (a personalized research feed), this abstract aligns well. The study is both methodologically novel and substantively informative about interpersonal relationships, likely to interest and even impress a donor looking for cutting-edge research in the area. The distribution channel (email and social) does not pose any barrier to understanding or appreciation.\n\nWhile the thesis includes broader themes, such as computational modeling of societal mobility, the strong and explicit focus on personal/ego-networks and interpersonal ties makes it highly relevant to the user's interests and the motivation for the feed.",

          "affinityExplanation": "This abstract is highly aligned with the stated interest in studies of interpersonal relationships, as a central component of the thesis involves the computational analysis and modeling of personal social networks and interpersonal ties. The research offers both empirical findings and theoretical validation directly related to how individuals maintain and experience their social connections. The slight deduction from 10 acknowledges that not all aspects of the thesis focus solely on interpersonal dynamics, but the majority of the content is a strong conceptual match."

          "title": "Temporal patterns of reciprocity in communication networks"
        },
        "relevanceScore": {
          "reasoning": "The research paper abstract investigates the temporal dynamics of reciprocity in human communication across various platforms (calls, messaging, social media). It proposes new measures for reciprocity based on the time ordering of interactions, analyzes patterns across different communication types, and theorizes about the mechanisms underlying the formation of norms and cooperation in social exchange. The study is oriented around understanding how individuals interact reciprocally in social networks, particularly focusing on concepts such as memory of past interactions and the difference between reciprocal and broadcast communication.\n\nThe reader's explicit interest is in 'studies that deal with interpersonal relationships.' There is a direct thematic connection: reciprocity and repeated interaction are foundational aspects of interpersonal relationships, as they are about exchanges between individuals and the maintenance of social ties. The paper does not deal with specific types of relationships (e.g., romantic, familial), but its exploration of the mechanics of reciprocal interaction is conceptually central to understanding how interpersonal relationships function over time, both online and offline. The study’s theoretical contribution on the emergence of norms and large-scale cooperation further deepens its relevance for readers interested in relationship dynamics.\n\nGiven that the motivation is to create a personalized feed based on user interests, and considering that the reader is a donor for the department, the inclusion of this research aligns well with showing the innovation and progress in areas the donor cares about, potentially reinforcing their interest and support. The work is likely to both inform and engage someone interested in how interpersonal ties are formed and maintained.\n\nThere is a strong alignment between the study’s focus and the reader’s stated interests, especially in the context of showcasing relevant departmental scholarship to a supporter.",

          "affinityExplanation": "This study is highly relevant to a reader interested in interpersonal relationships. By examining the patterns and mechanisms of reciprocity—central to interpersonal relationships—across real communication networks, the paper offers significant conceptual value to the intended reader. While not focused on one-on-one romantic or familial bonds, the general insights about reciprocal interaction and social cohesion map closely to the interests described. The content supports the motivation to deliver personalized, interest-based research updates. The only reason it's not a perfect 10 is a slight lack of applied focus on specific types of interpersonal relationships, but the overall conceptual connection is very strong."
