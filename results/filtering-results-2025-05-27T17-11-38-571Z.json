          "abstract": "We are citizens of the digital age, an age in which our smallest everyday actions leave digital traces behind. These traces can be used to reconstruct and analyse the patterns of human behaviour at both individual and societal levels. The growing abundance of quantitative data on almost every aspect of human behaviour is driving a paradigm shift from traditional social sciences to computational social sciences. This thesis utilises a wide range of digital traces of human behaviour to study and model the structure of social networks, as well as population-level patterns of commuting and travelling. A longitudinal study of these patterns reveals that while both personal social networks and population commuting networks are dynamic and undergo gradual changes and abrupt external disturbances, they also exhibit persistence in certain aspects and retain some of their distinctive features. Our work advances the knowledge of personal networks by identifying their universal and individual features through the study of a large population and multiple communication media. To clarify the generative mechanisms behind the observed universal patterns and individual variations within them, we present an ego-network model that connects the structure of ego-networks to the communication strategies of egos. Furthermore, we utilise rich and high-resolution digital communication logs and computational methods to validate the predictions of sociological theories that predate the emergence of computational social science as a field. Particularly, we show that the temporal manifestation of social ties can indicate the extent of their multiplexity (i.e., whether multiple social contexts underlie the tie) and that the multiplexity of ties impacts their functional features, such as their role in network connectivity. In addition to social networks, this thesis enriches our understanding of human mobility patterns by building predictive models that employ digital traces data. These models are capable of real-time estimation of country-wide mobility flows, even amidst rapid and significant distortions in mobility patterns. Taken together, my results highlight the potential of digital trace data and computational methods for advancing our understanding of various aspects of human behaviour. It applies these insights to predict human behaviour, identify universal and individual human traits, and contribute to bridging the new field of computational social science with the rich tradition of classical social science.",

However, their decentralized nature imposes challenges for data collection and preprocessing, particularly for obtaining a real-time snapshot in a timely manner. This paper introduces FediLive, a framework designed to rapidly collect and preprocess the live feeds from Mastodon, generate a comprehensive snapshot in real-time, including user-generated contents, interaction networks, and users’ demographic attributes. Such a snapshot could further be leveraged for data analysis from different angles, leading to a deeper understanding of user activities on Mastodon. Using FediLive, we collected a 13-day snapshot of Mastodon, covering the publicly visible activities of all Mastodon users. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of FediLive, and reveals its potential in facilitating data-driven analysis for decentralized online social networks.",

          "abstract": "Human communication, the essence of collective social phenomena ranging from small-scale organizations to worldwide online platforms, features intense reciprocal interactions between members in order to achieve stability, cohesion, and cooperation in social networks. While high levels of reciprocity are well known in aggregated communication data, temporal patterns of reciprocal information exchange have received far less attention. Here we propose measures of reciprocity based on the time ordering of interactions and explore them in data from multiple communication channels, including calls, messaging and social media. By separating each channel into reciprocal and non-reciprocal temporal networks, we find persistent trends that point to the distinct roles of one-to-one exchange versus information broadcast. We implement several null models of communication activity, which identify memory, a higher tendency to repeat interactions with past contacts, as a key source of temporal reciprocity. When adding memory to a model of activity-driven, time-varying networks, we reproduce the levels of temporal reciprocity seen in empirical data. Our work adds to the theoretical understanding of the emergence of reciprocity in human communication systems, hinting at the mechanisms behind the formation of norms in social exchange and large-scale cooperation.",

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical importance of understanding epidemic dynamics, particularly the significant gaps in our knowledge that need addressing to better prepare for future pandemics. This thesis delves into the intricacies of disease spread within complex human interaction networks, underlining the pivotal role of individual connectedness in influencing epidemic outcomes. By developing theoretical models inspired by real-world epidemiological data, this work provides a nuanced exploration of disease transmission dynamics across networked populations, emphasizing the heterogeneous, spatial, homophilic, and temporal characteristics inherent in human social structures. A primary focus of this research is the investigation of intervention strategies, encompassing pharmaceutical measures, such as vaccination campaigns, and non-pharmaceutical interventions, including contact tracing techniques. These interventions are evaluated within more realistic network topologies, characterized by degree heterogeneity and group structures, to assess their effectiveness in mitigating epidemic spread. The thesis leverages mathematical and computational epidemiology to offer profound insights into optimizing intervention strategies within the complex web of human interactions, thereby contributing to the academic discourse and providing actionable intelligence for public health policy formulation and epidemic preparedness. The avenues of research opened by this work offer deeper insights into the mechanisms of epidemic spread in social networks. By using stylized modeling, the study was able to delve into the nontrivial ways epidemics spread through social networks. This modeling approach simplified the realworld dynamics into more analytically tractable forms, allowing the researchers to capture the essence of contact network structures and their crucial role in transmitting infectious diseases. The primary objective of this study was to identify new pathways for academic exploration and offer valuable perspectives that can enhance public health policies and epidemic response strategies. Ultimately, this work seeks to contribute to a better understanding of epidemic dynamics by bridging knowledge gaps and fostering a more resilient response to public health challenges in the face of complex human interactions.",

However, while the topic is relevant to systems analysts, the abstract focuses primarily on mathematical modeling and epidemiological data rather than societal transformations or philosophical implications. There is a meaningful but indirect connection, as understanding epidemic dynamics could inform public health policies—a facet of governance—but it does not explicitly dive into the implications for social structures or collective meaning-making systems beyond the health context. Additionally, the research aims to bridge gaps in epidemic preparedness, which speaks to institutional legitimacy and public response strategies under duress, albeit in a more technical and less conceptual manner than what the audience may typically look for.

Spatial patterns, culture, governance systems, socio-economic structures, planning methods, history, and collectively envisioned futures need to be accommodated. The literature suggests that landscape is a complex and dynamic socio-ecological system, the management and adaptation of which requires systemic and integrative approaches to respond to a wide variety of drivers of change, challenges, and interests. Based on activities developed in 15 European pilot landscapes, we identify some of the key factors and conditions affecting the generation of representative local networks for landscape adaptation to climate change. We illustrate how social learning and co-creation processes can be implemented in them and how their co-produced outcomes can help local communities overcome barriers and address critical issues in adaptive planning. Our results provide a framework for the creation of similar networks in other landscapes, exploring at the same time the interactions between the composition of networks, social learning, and the quality of the co-produced outputs as a fundamental step for the development of Landscape Adaptation Plans to Climate Change.",

          "reasoning": "The abstract discusses the development of landscape adaptation planning for climate change, emphasizing the integration of socio-ecological factors and stakeholder involvement in climate adaptation efforts. It outlines how social learning and co-creation processes in landscape adaptation can lead to useful outcomes that help local communities address critical challenges. The study's focus on co-produced outcomes and local networks may resonate with readers interested in how complexity and social learning can lead to systemic shifts. However, the direct focus on landscape adaptation, while relevant to climate change discussions, has a narrower application to the broader themes of societal transformations, power dynamics, or governance shifts represented in reader interests. The study does present an opportunity to understand collective decision-making at the community level but lacks a direct connection to systematic shifts in governance or belief systems at larger scales. Therefore, while there are relevant elements, the alignment with reader interests is somewhat indirect.",
          "affinityScore": 6,
          "affinityExplanation": "This research touches on community engagement and adaptation to change, which are pertinent to the transformation of societal systems. However, while it offers insights into localized responses to climate change, it does not strongly address broader systemic shifts in governance or societal organization, making the connection to reader interests a bit tenuous."
