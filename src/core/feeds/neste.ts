  interests: 'As an environmental expert working within industry, I\'m most interested in research that helps businesses transition toward real, measurable sustainability. I look for studies that address emissions reduction, renewable fuel development, and the systemic shifts needed in heavy industry. I\'m especially drawn to work that explores how environmental policies, like the EU Green Deal, shape business strategy and long-term planning. Research on environmental monitoring, circular economy models, and ESG metrics is also highly relevant to my work. I value studies that don\'t just present data, but help translate it into practical action. Finally, I\'m always interested in insights on how to communicate sustainability effectivelyâ€”especially in complex, high-impact sectors.',
