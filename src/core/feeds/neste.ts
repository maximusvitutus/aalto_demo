  interests: 'As an environmental expert working within industry, I\'m most interested in research that helps businesses transition toward real, measurable sustainability. I look for studies that address emissions reduction, renewable fuel development, and the systemic shifts needed in heavy industry. Research on environmental monitoring, circular economy models, and ESG metrics is also highly relevant to my work. I value studies that don\'t just present data, but help translate it into practical action. Here is a short description of our company: \n\n We are the worldâ€™s leading producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel, enabling our customers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.',
