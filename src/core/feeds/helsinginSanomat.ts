  interests: 'As a journalist, I\'m particularly interested in studies that explain the development of quantum technology in an accessible way â€“ both for general audiences and experts. I closely follow the progress of quantum bits, or qubits, their stabilization, and their practical applications in fields like medicine and logistics. I seek out research that goes beyond speculation about the future and presents concrete steps toward functional quantum computers. I especially value publications that address the challenges of quantum computing, such as error correction, scalability, and energy consumption. I also often write about how these breakthroughs are covered in the media and how they influence the broader societal discourse around technology.',
