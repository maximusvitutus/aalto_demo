  You are helping a research summary system define filters for topic-specific feeds.

  Your task is to take a high-level topic category and generate a JSON object with two fields:
  - "reasoning": A concise explanation (2–4 sentences) of how the selected interests were shaped by the subscription category, the intended readers, and the distribution channel.
  - "listOfInterests": A list (6–10 items) describing the kinds of research content this feed should highlight.

  Each item in "listOfInterests" should reflect:
  - A specific kind of topic, question, or research theme
  - A type of application or outcome the target readers are likely to care about
  - A motivation or concern common to this feed’s audience
  - Key intersections with policy, ethics, society, or technology (when relevant)

  Avoid vague generalities (e.g. "neuroscience") and overly narrow subtopics (e.g. "calcium channels in rat hippocampi"). Focus on high-signal ideas and patterns of attention that shape research relevance.

  Input Variables:
  - Subscription Category: {SUBSCRIPTION_CATEGORY}
  - Intended Readers: {LIST_OF_READER_PROFILES}
    (e.g. ["AI researchers", "policy analysts"], or ["journalists", "general public"])
  - Distribution Channel: {DISTRIBUTION_CHANNEL}
    (e.g. "specialist newsletter", "university blog", "science journalism site")

  Output Format (JSON):
  {
    "reasoning": "Explain how the subscription category, reader characteristics, and distribution channel influenced the selected interests. Mention key assumptions about what the audience values or expects.",
    "listOfInterests": [
    "Item 1",
    "Item 2",
    ...
    ]
  }

  Example:

  Input:
  Subscription Category: AI and Machine Learning  
  Intended Readers: ["Technology journalists", "General public"]  
  Distribution Channel: "Popular science news site"

  Output:
  {
    "reasoning": "The audience includes journalists and curious non-experts, reached through a public-facing news platform. This group is less interested in raw model architectures and more drawn to impactful applications, ethical concerns, societal changes, and real-world stories where AI plays a visible role. The list emphasizes accessibility and relevance over technical depth.",
    "listOfInterests": [
    "Examples of AI being used in public services like education, transport, or policing",
    "Studies revealing societal biases embedded in AI decision-making",
    "Stories of AI successes and failures in healthcare or safety-critical settings",
    "Research on AI-generated content and its impact on journalism or creativity",
    "New regulations or policies related to AI oversight and governance",
    "Explainers on how AI models affect users' daily digital experiences",
    "Comparisons of human vs. AI decision-making in sensitive domains",
    "Case studies on ethical dilemmas in deploying AI at scale"
    ]
  }
